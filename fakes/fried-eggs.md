For the egg white:
| Amount | Ingredient
| :----: | :---------
| 2 | 14 oz package extra firm silken tofu (vacuum packed Mori Nu brand)
| 2 Tbsp | melted refined coconut oil
| 1 cup | rice flour
| 2 Tbsp | cornstarch
| 1 teaspoon | kala namak
| 1 cup | cold water
| 1/8 tsp | agar powder

For the yolk:
| Amount | Ingredient
| :----: | :---------
1 cup | of the egg white mix
1/4 cup | nutritional yeast
1/2 tsp | turmeric
1/4 tsp | paprika
3/4 tsp | kala namak
1 Tbsp | melted refined coconut oil
2 tsp | tomato paste

## Instructions

1. In a blender, combine all of the egg white ingredients and blend until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl using a rubber spatula to scrape the sides.

1. Now on to the yolk. Take one cup of egg white mix and add it back to the blender. Add in nutritional yeast, turmeric, paprika, the additional kala namak, additional tablespoon of coconut oil and the tomato paste. Blend until smooth. Transfer mixture to a smaller mixing bowl. 

1. Preheat a well seasoned cast iron over medium heat. Spray with a little cooking spray (I like coconut). Do a tablespoon test of the egg white. It should cook in about 2 minutes and be matte on top, golden underneath. If it burns, lower the heat, if it takes too long, raise it a little. 

1. Ok now make the eggs. Spray the pan with cooking spray. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup filled about 3/4 of the way and pour into the pan in a circle, leaving a hole in the middle. Fill the hole with about a tablespoon of yolk. Depending on the side of the pan you can do 3 to 5 eggs per round.

1. Let it cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until matte on top. Spray with more cooking spray, use a thin metal spatula to flip and cook on the other side for 30 seconds to a minute. Transfer to parchment as you continue with the others.
