# Feta Cheese

## Crumbly or Spreadable Feta Cheese

Adapted from [A Virtual Vegan: Crumbly or Spreadable Feta Chese](https://avirtualvegan.com/vegan-feta-cheese/#wprm-recipe-container-18712).

### Ingredients

| Amount | Ingredient
| :----: | :---------
| 350 g / 12 oz | extra firm or drained firm tofu, no need to press
| 120 ml / ½ cup | refined coconut oil, melted 
| 45 ml / 3 Tbsp | lemon juice
| 30 ml / 2 Tbsp | apple cider vinegar
| 1 Tbsp | nutritional yeast
| 1 tsp | onion powder
| ½ tsp | garlic powder
| ¼ tsp | dried dill
| 1 tsp | salt, plus more for adjusting the saltiness

#### Notes:

* Use refined coconut oil, unrefined or virgin coconut oil will add a coconut flavor to the feta.
* The dried dill imparts a "feta flavor," there is no dill taste in the finished feta.

### Instructions

1. Add all of the ingredients to a food processor or high-powered blender, a food processor makes it easier extract the finished feta.
1. Blend it all up until smooth then taste and add more salt as needed.
1. Blend to incorporate it after each addition of salt. Remember that this is feta so it should have quite a salty edge. I like to use a full 2 teaspoons in mine.

#### FOR SOFT SPREADABLE VEGAN FETA (THAT WILL ALSO MELT):

1. Serve straight from the blender, or pack into a container and refrigerate for a few hours for a firmer, spreadable cheese. If you want to be able to turn it out for use on a cheese board, line the container with cling-wrap so that you can easily remove it once it's set.

#### FOR FIRM, CUBE-ABLE & CRUMBLY VEGAN FETA:

1. Line an oven proof pan/dish with baking parchment. A square or rectangular shaped pan/dish is best if you want to be able to cut perfect cubes once it's ready. A loaf pan will work well. It doesn't matter if the cheese doesn't fill the container. You just need the cheese to be between 1 and 2 inches deep once it's in there. 
1. Spoon the cheese from the food processor into the oven proof dish and push it down well and evenly. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight is fine). This step is important. If you don't refrigerate before baking, the coconut oil can separate a little on the bottom while cooking. 
1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200 °C) and once at temperature, remove the cheese from the fridge and bake uncovered for 35 minutes. 
1. Remove from the oven. It will be puffy, a bit soft and bubbly but will set again as it cools. Allow to cool, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight) before cubing or crumbling.
