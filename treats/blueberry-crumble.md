# Blueberry Crumble

Adapted from Moira Dodgson's [Blueberry Crumble](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/10453-blueberry-crumble) recipe from the NY Times.

**Serves: 8**

## Ingredients

| Amount   | Ingredient
| :----:   | :---------
| 2  pints | blueberries
|          | Juice of 1/2 lemon
| 1  Tbsp  | instant tapioca
| 6  Tbsp  | cold unsalted butter
| 1  cup   | all-purpose flour
|          | Pinch of salt
| 1  Tbsp  | grated lemon peel


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
1. Place blueberries in an eight-inch baking dish two inches deep. Squeeze lemon juice on top. In a small bowl, blend tapioca with two tablespoons sugar. Add to berries and mix.
1. Cut the butter in pieces. Combine with the remaining sugar, flour and salt in a mixing bowl or food processor fitted with a steel blade. If using your fingers, blend the mixture until it has the texture of coarse bread crumbs. Blend in the lemon peel.
1. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the blueberries. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until the juices are bubbling and the top is golden brown. Cool for about 10 minutes and serve warm.
