## Ingredients

### Dough

| Amount    | Ingredient

| 3 Tbsp    | vegan butter (Melt)
| 2 1/4 tsp | quick-rise instant yeast
| 1 cup     | unsweetened oat or nut milk
| 1 Tbsp    | sugar
| 1/2 tsp   | salt
| 2 cups    | unifine or unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading

### FILLING

| Amount  | Ingredient
| :----:  | :---------
| 3 Tbsp  | vegan butter (Melt, melted)

| 1 Tbsp  | ground cinnamon (to taste)
| 1 1/2 cups  | toasted pecans, chopped
| 1/2 cup   | golden raisens or other dried fruit

### TOPPING

| 2 Tbsp | vegan butter (Melt, melted)

## Instructions

### Dough:
1. In a large sauce pan (or in a bowl in the microwave at 30-second increments), heat the almond milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 110 degrees F (43 C) or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
1. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add 1 Tbsp sugar and the salt and stir.
1. Next add in flour 1/2 cup (68 g) at a time, stirring as you go (you may not add it all). The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball (be careful not to overmix). Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with avocado or olive oil, and add your dough ball back in. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size (see photo).

### Assembly:
1. Toast and chop pecans.
1. Mix pecans, raisens, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle (about HxW). Brush with melted vegan butter and top with filling.
1. Starting on a long edge, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in a well-buttered 8x8-inch square or comparable sized round pan (you should have about 10 rolls as original recipe is written). 

### Second Rise & Baking:
1. Brush with vegan butter (melted) and cover with plastic wrap. Set on top of the oven to let rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Let the rolls rise until the rolls have puffed up noticably.
1. Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve immediately.
