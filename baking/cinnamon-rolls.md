## Ingredients

### Dough

| Amount    | Ingredient

| 1 cup     | unsweetened oat or nut milk
| 3 Tbsp    | vegan butter (Melt)
| 2 1/4 tsp | quick-rise instant yeast
| 1 Tbsp    | sugar
| 1/2 tsp   | salt
| 2 cups    | unifine or unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading

### FILLING

| Amount  | Ingredient
| :----:  | :---------
| 3 Tbsp  | vegan butter (Melt, melted)
| 1/4 cup | light brown sugar
| 1 1/2 Tbsp  | ground cinnamon (Korintje)
| 1 1/2 cups  | toasted pecans, chopped
| 1/4 cup   | golden raisens or other dried fruit

### TOPPING

| 2 Tbsp | vegan butter (Melt, melted)

## Instructions

### Dough:
1. Heat the milk and vegan butter until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 110 degrees F (43 C) – the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
1. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast and sugar. Let activate for 10 minutes. Then add the salt and stir.
1. Next add in flour, 1/2 cup (68 g) at a time, stirring as you go (you may not add it all). The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball (take care not to overwork). Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with a neutral oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and set in a warm place to rise until doubled in size (about an hour).

### Assembly:
1. Toast and chop pecans.
1. Mix pecans, raisens, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl.
1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle (about HxW). Brush with melted vegan butter and top with filling.
1. Starting on a long edge, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough in half, then into quarters, finally divide each quarter into three sections and position in a well-buttered 8x8-inch square or comparable sized round pan (you should have about 12 rolls as original recipe is written). 

### Second Rise & Baking:
1. Brush the tops of the rolls with the remaining melted butter.  Cover and set on top of the oven to let rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Let rise until the rolls have puffed up noticably.
1. Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve immediately.
