1. Mix wet ingredients into dry
1. Add corn and berries
1. Fill loaf pan(s) about 3/4 of the way full
1. Bake in mini loaf pans for 25 minutes, or until the loaf starts to smell and are nicely browned on top (and a toothpick comes out clean).

## Notes

* Roughly scaling to 3 loaves (x 1.5) resulted in a very wet batter, adding 1/2 cup of flour corrected it.
