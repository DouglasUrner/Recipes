**Makes: 1 Loaf or 2 Mini Loaves** 

## Ingredients

| Amount     | Ingredient
| :----:     | :---------
| 1 cup      | corn meal
| 1 cup      | flour, unifine or unbleached white
| 1 tsp      | baking powder
| 1 tsp      | baking soda
| 1/2 tsp    | salt
| 2 Tbsp     | sugar
| 1 1/4 cups | non-dairy milk
| 1 Tbsp     | distilled white vinegar
1 1 Tbsp     | neutral oil (canola, avocado, coconut (melted), etc)
| 1/2 tsp    | vanilla extract
| 3/4 cup    | corn kernels (thawed if frozen)
| 1 1/2 cups | fresh blueberries

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 425° F (235° C)
1. Combine dry ingredients
1. Combine wet
1. Mix wet ingredients into dry
1. Add corn and berries
1. Fill loaf pan(s) about 3/4 of the way full
1. Bake in mini loaf pans for 25 minutes, or until the loaf starts to smell and are nicely browned on top (and a toothpick comes out clean).

## Notes

* Roughly scaling to 3 loaves (x 1.5) resulted in a very wet batter, adding 1/2 cup of flour corrected it.
