| :----: | :---------
|  | Ginger (small fresh piece, frozen square or from the tube, ground will even work)
|  | Chicken broth (but water works too) or chicken bouillon
|  | Quinoa (if you donâ€™t have quinoa, you could use pasta)
|  | Vegetable oil
|  | Rice wine vinegar (but another vinegar will do in these times of quarantine)
|  | Peanut butter
|  | Soy sauce (I will use coconut aminos because my daughter is allergic to soy)
|  | Honey
|  | Sesame oil
|  | Garlic (similar to ginger, whatever you have)
|  | Bell pepper-any color or another other vegetable you have and need to use up such as asparagus, green beans, zucchini, etc.
