**Serves:** 1

## Ingredients

| Amount | Ingredient
| :----: | :---------
| 1 | small garlic clove, smashed, minced, pressed or grated
| 1 Tbs | lemon juice 
| pinch | salt
| 2 Tbs | tahini

## Instructions

Grate a tiny garlic clove (or half of large one) into a bowl, and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and pinch of salt. Whisk in 2 tablespoons tahini. When it’s all nice and smooth, loosen the mixture with a little warm water, whisked in a teaspoon at time. It should be pourable but not runny. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice, if need be.
