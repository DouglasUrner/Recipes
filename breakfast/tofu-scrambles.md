# Tofu Scrambles

Adapted from [Silken Tofu Scramble](https://sarahsvegankitchen.com/recipes/soft-tofu-scramble/).

**Serves:** 

## Ingredients

| Amount | Ingredient
| :----: | :---------
| 16 oz  | soft or silken tofu
| 1 heaping Tbsp | nutritional yeast
| ½ tsp | garlic powder
| ½ tsp | onion powder
| ½ tsp | turmeric, optional, for color
| ¾ cup | sautéed veggies*
| pinch | black salt, optional, to garnish
| | salt and pepper, to taste 


## Instructions

1. Very carefully remove tofu from packaging without breaking apart. Cut tofu into roughly 1″ cubes. This may seem large, but the tofu will shrink considerably as it cooks, and it will inevitably break apart a bit as you stir it due to its delicate texture, so it will resemble more of a scramble once you’re done. The key for this recipe is to be gentle while handling and stirring the tofu so that it doesn’t get too mushy.
1. Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. We *really* don’t want our tofu to stick, so if the pan’s nonstick coating is a little old or worn, add a few teaspoons of oil for extra insurance. Carefully transfer tofu to preheated pan. Allow the first side of the tofu cubes to cook undisturbed until a light golden brown “skin” has formed. This may take quite awhile (up to 3-5 full minutedepending on your tofu, as soft and silken varieties contain so much excess liquid which must first be cooked off before they will brown.
1. Once the first side is browned, very gently flip tofu with a spatula, and continue to cook, flipping carefully every minute or so until roughly all sides have lightly browned. Reduce the heat to medium once most of the extra liquid has cooked off. Tofu will shrink considerably as it cooks.
1. Once the tofu has been browned evenly, stir in nutritional yeast, onion and garlic powder, and a pinch of kosher salt and pepper. Stir in your cooked veggies of choice to heat through, along with any other add-ins such as vegan sausage, cheese, etc. (I highly recommend cooking your veggies separately, setting them aside and adding them to the tofu at this stage. If you try to cook the veggies in the pan alongside the soft tofu before it has developed a skin, there’s a good chance your tofu will turn to mush from all the extra stirring.)
1. Stir in a generous sprinkle of black salt at the last minute before serving if desired. (The flavor/aroma of the black salt tends to diminish if it’s cooked a lot.)
